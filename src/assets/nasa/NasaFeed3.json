In the telescopic field of view two bright yellowish stars, Mu and Eta Geminorum, stand just below and above the Jellyfish Nebula at the left. Cool red giants, they lie at the foot of the celestial twin. The Jellyfish Nebula itself floats below and left of center, a bright arcing ridge of emission with dangling tentacles. In fact, the cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shaped supernova remnant IC 443, the expanding debris cloud from a massive star that exploded. Light from that explosion first reached planet Earth over 30,000 years ago. Like its cousin in astrophysical waters the Crab Nebula supernova remnant, the Jellyfish Nebula is known to harbor a neutron star, the remnant of the collapsed stellar core. Composed on April 30, this telescopic snapshot also captures Mars. Now wandering through early evening skies, the Red Planet also shines with a yellowish glow on the right hand side of the field of view. Of course, the Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away, while Mars is currently almost 18 light-minutes from Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2105/Guenzel-JellyfishMars30APR2021.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Jellyfish and Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2105/Guenzel-JellyfishMars30APR2021_1000.jpg"},{"copyright":"\nNaoyuki Kurita\n","date":"2000-11-06","explanation":"Tomorrow's picture: The Gum Nebula  < | Archive | Index | Search | Calendar | Glossary | Education | About APOD | >  Authors & editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (USRA) NASA Technical Rep.: Jay Norris.

Once considered a false dawn, this triangle of light is actually Zodiacal Light, light reflected from interplanetary dust particles.  The bright reflecting triangle is clearly visible on the right of the above image taken from Laguna Verde near Valpara\ufffdso, Chile in late July. The band of our Milky Way Galaxy on the left mirrors the zodiacal band.  Zodiacal dust orbits the Sun predominantly in the same plane as the planets: the ecliptic.  Zodiacal light is so bright in the north this time of year because the dust band is oriented nearly vertical at sunrise, so that the thick air near the horizon does not block out relatively bright reflecting dust.  Zodiacal light is also bright for people in Earth's northern hemisphere in March and April just after sunset. In the southern hemisphere, zodiacal light is most notable after sunset in late summer, and brightest before sunrise in late spring.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0910/zodiacal_soria_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Zodiacal Light Over Laguna Verde","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0910/zodiacal_soria.jpg"},{"date":"2010-06-01","explanation":"Is the heart and soul of our Galaxy located in Cassiopeia?  Possibly not, but that is where two bright emission nebulas nicknamed Heart and Soul can be found.  The Heart Nebula, officially dubbed IC 1805 and visible in the above right, has a shape in optical light reminiscent of a classical heart symbol. The above image, however, was taken in infrared light by the recently launched WISE telescope. Infrared light penetrates well inside the vast and complex bubbles created by newly formed stars in the interior of these two massive star forming regions. Studies of stars and dust like those found in the Heart and Soul Nebulas have focussed on how massive stars form and how they affect their environment. Light takes about 6,000 years to reach us from these nebulas, which together span roughly 300 light years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1006/heartsoul_wise_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"WISE: Heart and Soul Nebulas in Infrared","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1006/heartsoul_wise.jpg"},{"date":"1998-10-13","explanation":"Here's part of the Dumbbell Nebula that you can't see through binoculars.   To see this, we suggest a sophisticated spectrograph attached to a telescope with an 8-meter aperture. Pictured above is the central part of the Dumbbell Nebula, also known as M27 and NGC 6853.  The Dumbbell is a planetary nebula created by the aging bright star visible just right of center.  The nebula, located in the constellation Vulpecula, is thousands of years old. Visible in this false-color photograph is glowing hydrogen gas (green) and enigmatical globules of dense molecular gas and dust (red).","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/m27center_vlt_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"In the Center of the Dumbbell Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/m27center_vlt.jpg"}]
